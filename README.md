# Website-Test

Building a simple website from GFM.

There are a few ways to do this but I plan to host on:

coffeeandcode.neocities.org

I think neocities is cool and I'd like to support it in a small way.

I'm using Grip to convert GFM to HTML. The HTML can then be uploaded to Neocities.

There is some post-processing required to tidy up the output of Grip.

To install Grip (on Mac OS X):

``` shell
brew install grip
```

Running Grip:

``` shell
grip file.md --export --no-inline file.html
```

You can of course preview `*.md` fine in GitHub.

I have used Hugo before, but honestly, I don;t need anything too fancy
for this.
