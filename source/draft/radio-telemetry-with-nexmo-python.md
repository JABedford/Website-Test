# Cheap radio telemetry with Nexmo and Python

Summary: This article looks at how to set up a cheap radio telemetry
system using Arduino or Raspberry Pi with an SMS shield, Nexmo and a
little bit of Python on the back end.

I crawled further down the cable duct and got an attack of
claustrophobia. It was in the depths of a Norwegian winter and depsite
the heat being generated by the TransOcean 8's vast diesel room I was
half frozen. I crawled a bit further dragging the armoured cable
behind me. Only a few more metres to go and I'd drop, literally, into
the pit room where I'd already installed my junction box. TO8's pit
room was the biggest I'd seen, with twelve main pits. Most rigs I'd
been on only had 3. TO8 was the mother of all wildcat rigs, ploughing
its trade in godforsaken stretches of the North Sea. Despite the dark
storm raging outside the TO8 was rock steady, a testament to is
immovable bulk, kept in position by state of the art GPS and huge
computer-controlled thrusters. I lugged the cable a bit
further. Nearly there. I dropped down into the pit room, exhausted,
and pondered how much easier my life would be if I didn't have to lug
cables around. So far, I reckoned I'd wired up 50 sensors, and I was
probably half-done. The most dangerous to install had been the kelly
height sensor. I'd been winched up into the derrick by a roughneck
who'd just wrked 14 ours straight. At one point I think he fell asleep
standing up, leaving me dangling in mid air. I quickly tie-wrapped the
kelly bottle onto the block, a sensor as simple as it was ingenious -
a pressurized system of water and air - you went up - more water
pressure on a strain gauge, you went down, less pressure. I shouted
down to the roughneck and slowly descended.

The most claustrophic had been the rotary table RPM sensor. I'd had to
squueze into a tiny crawl space under the rotary table, the table
powered by a vast electric motor, that turned the entire drill string,
a couple of miles of the stuff, probing down into prehistoric rock
formations. 

I dropped down into an empty pit and grumbling to myself started
welding in a bracket for the mud level sensor, and wished the whole
mess of cables, the bane of my life, would just go away...

## So what is radio telemetry?

The above little vignette hints at a problem. When you have a biggish
data acquisition project you usually have to end up installing
literally miles of cable, which is a right Royal pain in the bum. A
better way is to use radio telemetry. In the age of the Internet of
Things this should be quite possible, and it is, within certain
limitations.

Radio telemetry is the ability to send data, especially data from
sensors and actuators, via radio waves running than through electrical
cables.

Radio telemetry is especially useful in scenarios where the source at
edge-of-network is, physically very remote, or possibly even
moving. Obvious when you try to run cables from the GPS sensor on a
train and wire it back to your logging unit you are in for some
trouble. Telemetry by radio waves is more or less essential. You could
simply store the data locally for downloading later, but this does not
give you the real-time data you need in many scenarios. OK by
real-time here we are not talking high frequency updates - we might
only need to know the position of the train every 30 seconds or
so. 

So, just to recap, radio telemetry is very useful 

1. Remote
2. Moving

Some examples:

- Geolocation of vehicle
- Weight of load e.g. refuse collection 
- Remote pumping station
- River level monitoring / flood warning
- Weather station
- Alarms of all kinds

## Limitations

1. Low frequency. Say one SMS per hour. For vehicle tracking you would
   probably send a messsage every minute, which would rack up costs of
   SMSs.
   
2. Small amounts of data.

## Nexmo SMS limitations

## Legal

I'm not sure you could use your typical unlimited SMS plan in such a
scenario. You would have to contact your provider. If you are sending
a lot of SMS your provider might kick up about it. Still one SMS an
hour for 24 SMS per day is not going to be too problematic - my
daughter used to send several hundred SMS a day when she was about 15!
