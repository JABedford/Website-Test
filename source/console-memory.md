# Ever expanding memory

Just thought it was interesting to take a look at console RAM sizes
over the years:

| Model         |   Year   |   RAM (MB) | VRAM (MB) |
|:--------------|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| Playstation 1 |  1994    | 2          | 1         |
| Playstation 2 |  2000    | 32         | 4         |
| Playstation 3 |  2006    | 256        | 256       |
| Playstation 4 |  2013    | 8000       | 256       |
| Playstation 5 |  2020?   |  ??        | ??        |


| Model         | Year   |  RAM (MB) | VRAM (MB)| 
|:--------------|:------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| Xbox          |  2001  | 64        | ?        |
| Xbox 360      |  2005  | 512       | ?        |
| Xbox One      |  2013  | 8000      | ?        |
| Xbox One X    |  2017  | 12000     | ?        |

A few other examples for comparison:

* Midway's [Hydro
  Thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydro_Thunder) arcade game
  was released in 1999, it had a Celeron processor and 64 MB RAM.
  
* Raspberry Pi 3 was released in 2016. It has 1 GB RAM.

There are still many practical systems in operation today that
have limited memory though. Some examples:

* Arduino Uno contains a ATmega328 chip which has 2k SRAM.

* Network routers - apparently [Superscale
  Networks](https://www.superscale.io) use Linux-based routers that
  only have 4 MB - 16 MB of RAM, I guess in order to save money.
