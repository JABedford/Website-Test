# About

Hi, I'm Tony. I'm a contract technical writer, specializing in writing
docs for developers.

This website holds a few thoughts and words on various technical
topics. I felt like I needed a place to store various notes and
thoughts I was accumulating and decided to share (inflict) my
ramblings on others through this site. It's also nice to occasionally
write with a slightly less professional voice than I normally have to
use!

You should consider this site to be "Currently under construction".

In the past I've been an employed technical writer and trainer for
companies such as Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group,
Oracle(MySQL), Sun Microsystems(MySQL), Alfresco Software. I've also
been a contract technical writer for companies such as ARM, Fotango,
The Open University, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now Qualcomm).

You can contact me through my [Contact page](./contact.html).
