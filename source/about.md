# About

Hi, I'm Tony. 

This website holds a few thoughts on various technical topics (as well
as on cats and coffee). I felt like I needed a place to keep various
notes I was accumulating and I decided to ~~share~~ inflict my
ramblings on others through this site. Sorry about that!

**Please note this site is not meant to be taken too seriously! I have
enough "serious" writing in my day job thanks very much!**

You can also read this website directly in [my
GitHub](https://github.com/tbedford) if you want to. I also store the
tools used to build this site there. I tend to like to know how things
work, so I generally prefer to take the DIY approach to things like
websites - so no fancy-pants Wordpress site here.

I am a big believer in "incremental improvement" so expect to see that
in play here.

## Technical interests

I have a wide range of technical interests that range over embedded
and real-time systems, operating systems, data-driven websites, and
business process automation.

## Coding

I have been programming on various systems since 1981. I started back
then using VAX-BASIC and Z80 assembly language. I have written code
since then in a variety of languages. 

I once wrote an oil rig data aquisition system in
TurboBASIC. TurboBASIC allowed event-driven programming (long before
Node) through the use of `ON KEY k GOSUB s` and `ON TIMER t GOSUB s`
constructs, without any assembly language. It's still one of the most
productive languages/environments I have ever used.

I have been programming in C, on and off, since around 1987. I most
recently wrote a couple of simple memory allocators in C after a
roughly ten year hiatus from the language.

I have been using Python on the side for around 3 years, mostly for
web scraping, HTML processing, and spreadsheet manipulation.

What my desktop typically looks like:

## Current employment

I'm a contract technical writer, specializing in writing docs for
software developers.

As a contract technical writer I've worked for ARM, Fotango, The Open
University, Alfresco Software, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now
Qualcomm).

## Past employment

In the past I've been a technical writer for companies such as
Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group, Oracle(MySQL), Sun
Microsystems(MySQL), and Alfresco Software.

I also have extensive experience as a technical trainer. Over the
years I've delivered courses on operating systems and Java technology
at Sony (HQ Tokyo), Motorola (Schaumberg, Chicago and Austin, Texas),
Sun Microsystems (Culver City), NTT DoCoMo (San Jose), Sharp Labs
(Portland), and even Amiga (Snoqualmie). 

I also designed and delivered a course on Embedded C for Nokia
(Camberley, UK), back when Nokia were numero uno.

## Personal

I have a cat! He's probably the most spoiled cat in the world, but all
owners probably say that. His name is Timmy. I adopted him some years
ago - he was a rescue:

And here's me being photo-bombed by a mermaid: ;)

I live in the UK but try to escape to the Philippines when I can.
