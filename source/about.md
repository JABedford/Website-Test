# About

Hi, I'm Tony. 

This website holds a few thoughts on various technical topics (as well
as on cats and coffee). I felt like I needed a place to keep various
notes I was accumulating and I decided to ~~share~~ inflict my
ramblings on others through this site. Sorry about that!

Please note this site is not meant to be taken too seriously! I have
enough "serious" writing in my day job thanks very much!

You can also read this website directly in [my
GitHub](https://github.com/tbedford) if you want to. I also store the
tools used to build this site there. I tend to like to know how things
work, so I generally prefer to take the DIY approach to things like
websites - so no fancy-pants Wordpress site here.

I am a big believer in "incremental improvement" so expect to see that
in play here.

## Technical interests

I have a wide range of technical interests, but currently I seemed to
be most interested in data-driven websites, information retrieval and
process automation. Python is especially good in this arena.

## Coding

Although I enjoy coding I am **not** one of those coding geniuses you
hear about.

However, I _can_ code in Python and C. I have also worked with Java,
Objective-C, and C++ in the recent past, and if I go way back,
VAX-BASIC, F77, COBOL, and Z-80 assembly language (all thankfully long
since forgotten)!

I once wrote an oil rig data aquisition system in TurboBASIC. It's
still one of the most productive languages I have ever used.

Recent C projects have included a couple of attempts at my own memory
allocator. It included nifty features such as block splitting and
coalescing in an effort to reduce memory fragmentation. I wrote
extensive documentation for both attempts, which you can read in my
GitHub.

I have also recently worked on various Python data munging and web
scraping projects.

What my desktop typically looks like:

## Current employment

I'm a contract technical writer, specializing in writing docs for
software developers.

As a contract technical writer I've worked for ARM, Fotango, The Open
University, Alfresco Software, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now
Qualcomm).

## Past employment

In the past I've been a technical writer for companies such as
Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group, Oracle(MySQL), Sun
Microsystems(MySQL), and Alfresco Software.

I also have extensive experience as a technical trainer. Over the
years I've delivered courses on operating systems and Java technology
at Sony (HQ Tokyo), Motorola (Schaumberg, Chicago and Austin, Texas),
Sun Microsystems (Culver City), NTT DoCoMo (San Jose), Sharp Labs
(Portland), and even Amiga (Snoqualmie). 

I also designed and delivered a course on Embedded C for Nokia
(Camberley, UK), back when Nokia were numero uno.

## Personal

I have a cat! He's probably the most spoiled cat in the world, but all
owners probably say that. His name is Timmy. I adopted him some years
ago - he was a rescue:

I am currently based in the UK, but like to spend time in the
Philippines when I can. Here's why:
