# About

Hi, I'm Tony. I'm a contract technical writer, specializing in writing
docs for software developers.

This website holds a few thoughts and words on various technical
topics. I felt like I needed a place to store various notes and
thoughts I was accumulating and I decided to share (inflict) my
ramblings on others through this site. It's also nice to occasionally
write with a slightly less professional voice than I normally have to
use!

In the past I've been an employed technical writer for companies such
as Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group, Oracle(MySQL), Sun
Microsystems(MySQL), and Alfresco Software.

As a contract technical writer I've worked for ARM, Fotango, The Open
University, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now Qualcomm).

I also have extensive experience as a technical trainer. Over the
years I've delivered courses on operating system and Java technology
at Sony (HQ Tokyo), Motorola (Schaumberg, Chicago and Austin, Texas),
Sun Microsystems (Culver City), NTT DoCoMo (San Jose), Sharp Labs
(Portland), and even Amiga (Snoqualmie). I also designed and delivered
a course on Embedded C for Nokia (Camberley, UK).

You can contact me through my [Contact page](./contact.html).

You can read this website directly in [my
GitHub](https://github.com/tbedford). I also store the tools to build
this site there.

Here's my cat Timmy:
