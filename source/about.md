# About

Hi, I'm Tony. 

This website holds a few thoughts on various technical topics. I felt
like I needed a place to store various notes and I was accumulating
and I decided to share (inflict) my ramblings on others through this
site. Sorry about that! It's also nice to occasionally write with a
slightly less professional voice than I normally have to use!

You can also read this website directly in [my
GitHub](https://github.com/tbedford). I also store the tools used to
build this site there. I tend to like to know how things work, so I
generally prefer to take the DIY approach to things like websites - so
no fancy Wordpress site here.

## Technical interests

My interests mostly centre around databases and operating systems. I
can code in Python and C. I have also worked with Java and C++ in the
past, and if I go way back, VAX-BASIC, F77 and Z-80 assembly language
(all thankfully long since forgotten)! I recently became much more
interested in all aspects of distributed systems.

I love to code, and recently wrote a couple of versions of my own
memory allocator, that included nifty features such as block splitting
and coalescing. I have also worked on various data munging/web scraping
projects in the past.

## Current employment

I'm a self-employed contract technical writer, specializing in writing
docs for software developers.

As a contract technical writer I've worked for ARM, Fotango, The Open
University, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now Qualcomm).

## Past employment

In the past I've been a technical writer for companies such as
Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group, Oracle(MySQL), Sun
Microsystems(MySQL), and Alfresco Software.

I also have extensive experience as a technical trainer. Over the
years I've delivered courses on operating systems and Java technology
at Sony (HQ Tokyo), Motorola (Schaumberg, Chicago and Austin, Texas),
Sun Microsystems (Culver City), NTT DoCoMo (San Jose), Sharp Labs
(Portland), and even Amiga (Snoqualmie). I also designed and delivered
a course on Embedded C for Nokia (Camberley, UK), back when Nokia were
numero uno.

## Personal

I have a cat! He's probably the most spoiled cat in the world, but all
'parents' probably say that. His name is Timmy. I adopted him some
years ago - he was a rescue:

And here's me posing: ;)

I am currently based in the UK, but spend as much time as I can in the
Philippines. Here's why:
