    <p>One of the hardest aspects of this was retrofitting the correct
    metadata to my existing content. I had to work out what data would
    be required, and how this would be added to my content. In the end
    I settled on Published date, Updated date, Summary, and Title. In
    addition each article has a UUID. This is required by the Atom
    feed spec. A UUID can be generated easily enough on the command
    line (in Mac OS X), using the command uuidgen. This seemed to be
    sufficient for my purposes. I decided not to add the full content
    of the article to my feed, as the user can simply click on the
    article heading in a feed reader to read the content on my
    site. This has the advantage that it keeps the feed simpler and
    quicker to generate. The downside is the user will need to be able
    to access the web in order to read the content - if they were
    using a desktop feed reader the content would be saved for offline
    reading if I provided a full feed. In this case the advantages of
    speed of generation and simplicity outweighed this convenience for
    the user. However, in the future I could offer a full feed
    capability. This would be relatively simple to add to the existing
    code based on my investigations so far.</p>

<p>The other aspect I needed to determine was dates and how to format
them. The Atom feed uses ISO-8601 date times. I have already described
dates and the issues around them in my article dealing with dates, so
I won't go into these again here.</p>

<p>The data extracted from each article is used to populate an entry
in the Atom feed. The header and footer for the Atom feed are more or
less static pieces of text. The only requirement here is that the
header is patched with the date-time of the feed
generation. Essentially the entries are appended to the header in the
output file, and then the footer written before the feed file is
closed.</p>
